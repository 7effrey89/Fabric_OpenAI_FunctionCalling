Utilizing inbuilt OpenAI resource in Fabric - you dont need a seperate deployed openai resource :)

Demo also utilizes Function Calling in OpenAI GPT4, and keeps the chat history updated with the responses it sends to and gets from the function. 
This way the the llm always has the best context of where the dialog is moving.
